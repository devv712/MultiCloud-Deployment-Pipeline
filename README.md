ðŸ”§ Project: Scalable Multi-Cloud CI/CD Pipeline with Canary Deployments

What it does:
Build a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.Integrate Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and ArgoCD.Deploy across AWS + GCP (multi-cloud).Add Canary Deployment with rollback mechanism.Enable Slack/MS Teams alerts + Prometheus + Grafana monitoring.

Overview:
Shows mastery over multi-cloud DevOps.
Demonstrates zero-downtime deployment skills.
Involves real-world enterprise complexity.

Tech Stack:
GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, AWS EKS, GCP GKE, Prometheus, Grafana, Slack API.

This project builds a CI/CD pipeline that:
Automates build, test, and deployment workflows.
Deploys to both AWS and GCP (multi-cloud).
Uses Canary Deployment strategy to gradually release updates.
Monitors performance in real-time and triggers auto-rollback on failures.
Includes complete observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Alerting).

Detailed Flow og the project:
1. Code Push & CI
Developer pushes to GitHub.
GitHub Actions pipeline:
Lints & tests code.
Builds Docker image.
Pushes image to ECR (AWS) and GCR (GCP).

2. Infrastructure Setup with Terraform
Define infrastructure as code:
VPC, subnets, IAM roles, K8s clusters (EKS + GKE).
CI/CD runner permissions.
Use environment-based Terraform workspaces (e.g., staging, prod).

3. CD with ArgoCD & Argo Rollouts
ArgoCD watches Git repo for K8s manifests/Helm charts.
Argo Rollouts performs Canary Deployment:
Deploys new version to 10% users â†’ waits.
Prometheus checks CPU, memory, error rate.
Gradually increases traffic to 25%, 50%, 100%.

4. Monitoring & Observability
Use Prometheus to scrape app metrics.
Visualize via Grafana Dashboards.
Set alert thresholds (e.g., error rate > 2%).
Configure Alertmanager to send Slack/email alerts.

5. Auto-Rollback
If health checks fail at any stage of rollout:
Argo Rollouts auto-reverts to the stable version.
You get alert notification.

6. Multi-Cloud Distribution
Pipeline deploys the same service in:
EKS (AWS) for core production users.
GKE (GCP) for failover or load distribution.

âœ… Project has Add-ons:
Blue/Green deployment toggle via UI
SOPS or Vault for encrypted GitOps secrets.
Cost tracking via Kubecost.
Policy-as-Code with OPA Gatekeeper (enforces rules like no :latest tags).
Backup & disaster recovery plan with Velero.
