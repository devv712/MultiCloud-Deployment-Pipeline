# DevOps Pipeline Dashboard - Multi-Cloud CI/CD Monitoring

## Overview

A comprehensive DevOps pipeline monitoring dashboard that simulates multi-cloud CI/CD with canary deployments and real-time observability. This full-stack application provides enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities for modern DevOps workflows.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology stack**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Component structure**: Modular component architecture with reusable UI components
- **State management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket integration for live monitoring
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API design**: RESTful API with WebSocket support for real-time updates
- **Server configuration**: Express with CORS, WebSocket server integration
- **Storage**: In-memory storage with comprehensive seeded data

## Key Components

### Dashboard Features
1. **Multi-Cloud Pipeline Monitoring**: Real-time CI/CD pipeline status across AWS, GCP, and Azure
2. **Canary Deployment Tracking**: Progressive deployment monitoring with automatic rollback capabilities
3. **Infrastructure Management**: Multi-cloud resource monitoring with cost tracking
4. **Alert System**: Real-time alerting with severity-based categorization
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Live metrics dashboard with SLA compliance tracking

### Core Pages
- **Dashboard**: Overview with key metrics, trends, and recent activity
- **Pipelines**: CI/CD pipeline management and execution history
- **Deployments**: Canary deployment monitoring with simulation capabilities
- **Infrastructure**: Multi-cloud resource management and cost analysis
- **Alerts**: Alert management with resolution workflows
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics and observability

## Data Flow

### Real-time Architecture
- WebSocket connections provide live updates for pipeline status, deployment progress, and alerts
- React Query manages server state with automatic cache invalidation
- Backend broadcasts events for pipeline runs, deployment updates, and system alerts

### API Endpoints
- Pipeline management: `/api/pipelines`
- Deployment tracking: `/api/deployments` with canary simulation
- Infrastructure monitoring: `/api/infrastructure`
- Alert management: `/api/alerts`
- Real-time metrics: WebSocket at `/ws`

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, Recharts, Lucide Icons
- **Backend**: Express, WebSocket, Zod validation, CORS
- **Development**: Vite, PostCSS, class-variance-authority

### Simulated Services
- Multi-cloud infrastructure (AWS EKS, GCP GKE)
- CI/CD pipeline execution
- Canary deployment progression
- Health check monitoring
- Cost tracking and optimization

## Deployment Strategy

The application uses Replit's integrated development environment with:
- Vite dev server for frontend development
- Express server for API and WebSocket services
- Real-time hot reloading for development
- Production-ready build configuration
